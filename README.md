# xonsh-scripts
# Overview

As a software engineer I decided to learn how to use xonsh (https://xon.sh/) to further add to my abilities. I first went through the tutorial and got out a few of the useful commands and added to the useful commands to create a sort of cheat sheet. I then applied my knowledge in creating a script that could duplicate a website for personal projects. The script is also set to automatically push my code to github and only require my credentials as intervention.
